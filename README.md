# Brain-MRI-Segmentation

Various 2D segmentation algorithms are applied to each slice of the MRI data. The segmented results are compared with the true labels using suitable evaluation metrics. A 3D segmentation algorithm is used to segment the entire MRI data simultaneously and evaluated using the metric used for comparing 2D segmentation.
